LCD EXAMPLE1 - DIAGRAM DISPLAY TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="LCD1x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test code demonstrates following functionalities of the CSL LCDC module on the C5505/C5515 LCD panel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing a Rectangle</li>
<li>Drawing a Circle</li>
<li>Drawing a Line</li>
<li>Copying an Icon</li>
<li>Moving an Icon Drawing rectangle is done by drawRectangle() API which displays a Red color rectangle on the LCD. Drawing circle is done by drawCircle() API which displays a blue color circle on the LCD. Drawing line is done by drawLine() API which displays a white color line on the LCD. Copying icon is done by iconCopy() API which copies a small portion of image from the rectangle and displays on the LCD. This copied icon will be in the square shape. Moving icon is done by iconMove() API which moves a small portion of image from the circle and displays on the LCD. This moved icon will be in the rectangular shape. A Black colored rectangular hole will be created on the circle due to moving the icon from circle space. This example uses 65k color mode.</li>

LCD EXAMPLE2 - DMA POLL TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="LCD2x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test code demonstrates DMA mode of operation of the CSL LCD module. DMA module of LCD operates with out using the interrupts. During this test LCD panel will be filled with two colors; Blue and Red. Upper half of the LCD will be colored Blue and lower half of the LCD will be colored Red. Filling the colors will be done in two steps. In the first step test code configures CSL LCD module and DMA to fill upper half of the LCD with Blue color. In the second step test code configures CSL LCD module and DMA to fill lower half of the LCD with Red color. DMA used for LCD data transfer is internal to the LCD controller and is not the DMA of C5505/C5515 DSP. This example uses 256 color mode.</p>
<p>NOTE: Data buffer used by the LCD in DMA mode should be allocated in the SARAM. This test code places the 'gLcdBuf' in SARAM using pragma macro.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
   LCD display after running the test will be as shown below, when
   the LCD is viewed with JTAG port on the left hand side and Power port on the
   right hand side.

LCD EXAMPLE4 - TEXT DISPLAY TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="LCD4x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test code demonstrates displaying a string of characters on the LCD panel. Different text is displayed on the LCD panel in two steps.</p>
<p>In the first step two character strings are displayed on the LCD panel using DMA mode with text in White color. LCD panel is divided into two vertical parts to display the strings in separate planes. String "IMAGINATION IS BEGINNING OF CREATION.YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU DESIRE" will be displayed on the left half of the LCD. String "YOU WILL WHAT YOU IMAGINE AND AT LAST YOU CREATE WHAT YOU WILL" will be displayed on the right half of the LCD. This two strings will be displayed for few seconds and then text will be cleared line by line. During this step text displayed will be smaller in size as the LCD panel is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>In the second step one character string will be displayed on the LCD panel using polled mode with text in Red color. String "CSL FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS C5505(C5515) LCD MODULE" will be displayed on complete plane of the LCD. During this step text displayed will be bigger in size and more clear.</p>

LCD EXAMPLE5 - 65K COLOR MODE TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="LCD5x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test code demonstrates 65k color mode operation of CSL LCD module. LCD controller on the EVM supports three color modes; 256, 65k and 262k. In 65k color mode each color is represented using two 8 bit data. LCD controller on the EVM is interfaced to LCD panel using 8-bit data interface. Each pixel data will be sent to the LCD in two 16 bit words, each word carrying one 8-bit information of the color. Color information is transferred to LCDC registers using internal DMA module.</p>
<p>DMA module of LCD operates using the interrupts.During this test LCD panel will be filled with two colors; Red and Green. Upper half of the LCD will be filled Red color and lower half of the LCD will be filled with green color. Filling the colors will be done in two steps.
