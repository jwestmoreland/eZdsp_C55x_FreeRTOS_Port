UART EXAMPLE1 - POLL MODE TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="UART1x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test is to verify the CSL UART module operation in polled mode. This test code communicates with the HyperTerminal on the host PC through UART module on C5505/C5515 DSP operating in polled mode. UART peripheral is configured by the test code to the following values Baud Rate - 2400. Data bits - 8. Parity - None. Stop bits - 1. Flow control - None. HyperTerminal on the host PC should be configured with the same values to to proper communication with the C5505/C5515 EVM. C5505/C5515 EVM should be connected to the host PC using an RS232 cable and HyperTerminal on the host PC should be opened and connected.This test works at all the PLL frequencies.</p>
<p>Upon running the test, a message prompting to enter the string size will be displayed on HyperTerminal.Enter the string size which is greater than 1 and less than 99. String length should be two characters and the numbers below 10 should be preceded by 0(01,02,03...). After reading the string size a message prompting to enter the string will be displayed on HyperTerminal. Enter the string which is exactly of the length specified in the previous query. Once the string of the specified size is entered, test code will stop reading from the HyperTerminal and send message to inform that the reading from HyperTerminal has been stopped. After reading the string test code will send the same string back to the HyperTerminal.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
   Messages displayed on the HyperTerminal when entered a string
   "CSL UART TESTING" will be as shown below.

UART EXAMPLE3 - INTERRUPT MODE TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="UART3x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test is to verify the CSL UART module operation in interrupt mode. This test code communicates with the HyperTerminal on the host PC through UART module on C5505 DSP operating in interrupt mode. UART peripheral is configured by the test code to the following values. Baud Rate - 2400. Data bits - 8. Parity - None. Stop bits - 1. Flow control - None. HyperTerminal on the host PC should be configured with the same values to to proper communication with the C5505/C5515 EVM. C5505/C5515 EVM should be connected to the host PC using an RS232 cable and HyperTerminal on the host PC should be opened and connected.This test works at all the PLL frequencies.</p>
<p>This test code reads characters entered by the user on the HypeTerminal continuously one character at a time. For each character entered on the HyperTerminal, URAT generates a receive interrupt and the character is read in the Rx ISR. Symbol '$' needs to be entered on the HyperTerminal to terminate the test. Upon running the test, details of the test will be displayed on the HyperTerminal. A message will be displayed prompting to enter a character. Character entered on the HyperTerminal will be read by the test code and and echoed back to the HyperTerminal until the symbol '$' is entered on the HyperTerminal. Messages displayed to direct the user will be transmitted to the HyperTerminal using Polled mode.</p>
