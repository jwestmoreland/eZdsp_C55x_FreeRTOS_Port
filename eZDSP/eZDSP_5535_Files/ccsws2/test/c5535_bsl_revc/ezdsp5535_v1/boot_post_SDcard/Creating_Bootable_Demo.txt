Creating a Bootable Demo
------------------------
This file contains instructions for creating and flashing a bootable demo into the SD card that will run when the eZDSP is powered.

There are three major steps in flashing the demo.
1. Creating the demo program.
2. Creating the boot image.
3. Programming the boot image.

Creating the demo program
-------------------------
    This is a program that runs when the eZDSP is powered. Create a project with all the necessary setup and build it  to get a .out file. The "boot_post" test can be used for this.
Creating the boot image
-----------------------
The demo program needs to be converted to a bootable format for the boot image. This can be done by the following steps.
1. Copy the Demo program (.out file) to the folder "ezdsp5535_v1\boot_post\hex_utility".
2. In that directory, edit the last line and second last line of "demo.cmd" to reflect the input (.out) and output (.bin) file respectively.
3. Go to the Windows command prompt and change directory to the "hex_utility" directory.
4. Enter the following command in the command prompt:
   hex55 demo.cmd
5. The output .bin file will be created in the same directory.

Programming the boot image
--------------------------
This involves loading  boot image to the SD card. 

1. Rename the .bin file to "bootimg#.bin" where '#' denotes a character or number.
2. Make a backup of the .bin file in the SD card that was provided with the eZDSP or move it to a sub directory.
3. Copy the "bootimg#.bin" file that was created to the SD card. It should be in the top level with out any sub directories.
4. Remove all other .bin files from the top level. Bootloader will not look inside subdirectories so other boot images may be stored there.
5. Insert the SD card into the eZDSP and power it. The program will run when powered on.
