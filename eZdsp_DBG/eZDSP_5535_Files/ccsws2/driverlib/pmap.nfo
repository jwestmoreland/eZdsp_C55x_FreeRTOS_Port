ADVICE: In function PMAP_configurePorts() in pmap.c
	in the 'for' loop with loop variable 'i' at lines 56-59
	for the statement PxMAPy[i] = portMapping[i]; at line 58

	Consider declaring 'portMapping' as const unsigned char * const restrict portMapping
	or declaring 'PxMAPy' as  unsigned char * const restrict PxMAPy
	to assert that 'portMapping' in the address of portMapping[i];
	and            'PxMAPy' in the address of PxMAPy[i];
	do not access the same object in memory.
