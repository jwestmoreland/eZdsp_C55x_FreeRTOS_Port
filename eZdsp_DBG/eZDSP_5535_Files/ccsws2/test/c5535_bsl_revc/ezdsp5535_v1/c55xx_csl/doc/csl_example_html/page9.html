MEMORY EXAMPLE1 - DARAM RETENTION MODE TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="MEM1x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test verifies the memory retention mode feature of the C5505/C5515 DARAM. Internal memory of the C5505/C5515 DSP can be placed into a low power memory retention while retaining the content stored in the memory. This low power mode is activated through the Sleep Mode Memory Control. When the memory is placed in this mode, no accesses can occur. When the memory retention mode is enabled, inline diodes will be added to reduce the local power supply to the on-chip RAM.Memory retention mode can be enabled/disabled for the DARAM and SARAM independently.</p>
<p>A data buffer is allocated in the DARAM is initialized with some data. CSL memory module is initialized and memory retention mode for DARAM is enabled using the CSL API MEM_enableRetentionMode(). Memory retention mode will be disabled after few CPU cycles by using the CSL API MEM_disableRetentionMode(). Data in the DARAM buffer is verified after few CPU cycles of delay. Buffer should contain the data with which it was initialized before enabling the memory retention mode. This proves that the data stored in the DARAM is retained when it is placed into memory retention mode and is accessible after disabling the memory retention mode.</p>
<p>NOTE: DURING MEMORY RETENTION MODE TEST FOR DARAM ALL THE PROGRAM SECTIONS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE SARAM. ACCESSING THE DATA IN THE DARAM BY ANY WAY (CCS WATCH WINDOW, MEMORY WINDOW OR PLACING THE MOUSE POINTER ON THE DARAM DATA BUFFER TO VIEW THE VALUE) AFTER ENABLING THE MEMORY RETENTION MODE WILL CORRUPT ALL THE DATA IN DARAM.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5505 AND C5515. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.</p>

MEMORY EXAMPLE3 - DARAM PARTIAL RETENTION MODE TEST</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="MEM3x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>This test verifies the partial memory retention mode feature of the C5515 DARAM. Internal memory of the C5515 DSP can be placed into a low power memory retention while retaining the content stored in the memory. This low power mode is activated through the Sleep Mode Memory Control. When the memory is placed in this mode, no accesses can occur. When the memory retention mode is enabled, inline diodes will be added to reduce the local power supply to the on-chip RAM. Partial memory retention mode allows to enable sleep mode for a DARAM bank independent of other DARAM or SARAM memory banks.</p>
<p>During test, a data buffer allocated in the DARAM bank0 is initialized with data. CSL memory module is initialized and partial memory retention mode for DARAM bank 0 is enabled using the CSL API MEM_enablePartialRetentionMode(). Data in other DARAM banks is accessed to demonstrate that enabling partial retention mode for one memory bank will not effect rest of the banks. Memory retention mode will be disabled after few CPU cycles by using the CSL API MEM_disablePartialRetentionMode(). Data in the DARAM0 buffer is verified after few CPU cycles of delay. Buffer should contain the data with which it was initialized before enabling the memory retention mode. This proves that the data stored in the DARAM0 is retained when it is placed into memory retention mode and is accessible after disabling the memory retention mode. Same test is repeated for other DARAM banks.</p>
<p>NOTE: DURING MEMORY RETENTION MODE TEST FOR DARAM ALL THE PROGRAM SECTIONS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE SARAM. ACCESSING THE DATA IN THE RETENTION MODE ENABLED DARAM BANK BY ANY MEANS(CCS WATCH WINDOW, MEMORY WINDOW OR PLACING THE MOUSE POINTER ON THE DARAM DATA BUFFER TO VIEW THE VALUE) WILL CORRUPT ALL THE DATA IN THAT BANK.</p>
<p>NOTE: PARTIAL MEMORY RETENTION MODE IS SUPPORTED ONLY ON CHIP 5515. THIS TEST IS NOT VALID FOR CHIP 5505. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.</p>
