 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F66x Demo - RTC_B in real time clock mode
//
//   Description: The RTC_B module is used to set the time, start RTC operation,
//   and read the time from the respective RTC registers. Software will set the
//   original time to 11:59:45 am on Friday October 7, 2011. Then the RTC will
//   be activated through software, and the time will be read out once every 
//   second. The proper handling of the RTC interrupt is shown as well.
//
//  //* An external watch crystal on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//	
//   ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO~1MHz
//
